reading: The Death card represents a time of major change and transformation in your life. Endings are necessary to make way for new beginnings, and it's important to be open to the changes that are happening around you. You may be resisting change or struggling to let go of old patterns and beliefs, but it's important to remember that change is necessary for personal growth and progress. Ask yourself - what aspects of my life am I holding onto that no longer serve me? What changes am I afraid of making? What new opportunities might arise if I let go of the past and embrace the present? Remember, while change can be challenging, it can also be a time of great personal transformation and growth.
